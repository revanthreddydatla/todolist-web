This is a TodoList web application




































This read is for my own self acknowledgement
# todolist-web
todolist app developed using html, css, javascript, nodejs, expressjs, mongodb, mongoose, then deployed mongodb on mongodb atlas and server code on heroku
Learned i have to write all usernames and passwords used to connect to database or any api should be written in separate file we can ignore them when we need to upload our git repository to cloud git repos.
