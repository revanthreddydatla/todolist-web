This read is for my own self acknowledgement

This todolist app developed using html, css, javascript, nodejs, expressjs, mongodb, mongoose, first developed using local mongod server then deployed on mongodb atlas and server code on heroku
While pushing repo to github i have learned that i have to write all usernames and passwords used to connect to database or any api in separate file so that we can ignore them when we need to upload our local git repository to cloud.
